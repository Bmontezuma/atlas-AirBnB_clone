## How to start the project
## How to use it
## Command Interpreter
A command interpreter is a tool that allows you to interact with your project by entering commands. It's like a specialized interface where you can perform actions such as creating new users or places, retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

If you want to create a new user, you could use the following:

```pythoh
create User
```
or if you want to retrieve objects you could use the following:

```python
retrieve User from database
```
