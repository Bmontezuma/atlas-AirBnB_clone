# Atlas School - airbnb clone

![airbnb clone](https://github.com/manningstinson/atlas-AirBnB_clone/assets/104523090/2293c7ad-a821-417a-8acb-dc2c6961d06b)

In this six part project, two team members are creating a clone of the airbnb travel website. The first project will be a console, or shell to access the project from the terminal/command line.

## Learning Objectives

### Creating a Python Package:
To create a Python package, you typically organize your code into a directory and include an __init__.py file in that directory. This file can be empty or contain initialization code. You can then include your Python modules within this directory. Optionally, you might want to include a setup.py file to define metadata about your package, such as its name, version, dependencies, etc.

### Creating a Command Interpreter with the cmd Module
Python's cmd module allows you to easily create a command-line interpreter. You subclass the cmd.Cmd class and define methods for each command. The cmdloop() method starts an interactive command loop.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of your code in isolation to ensure they work correctly. In Python, you can use the built-in unittest module or third-party libraries like pytest. To implement unit testing in a large project, you typically write test cases for each unit or function and organize them into test suites. You can then run these tests automatically using a testing framework.

### Serializing and Deserializing a Class:
You can serialize a class instance into a format like JSON or pickle using Python's built-in json or pickle modules. Serialization converts an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization reconstructs the object from that format.

### Reading and Writing a JSON File:
Python's json module provides functions for reading and writing JSON files. You can use json.dump() to write JSON data to a file and json.load() to read JSON data from a file.

### Managing DateTime:
Python's datetime module provides classes for working with dates and times. You can create datetime objects representing specific dates or times, perform arithmetic operations on them, format them as strings, and more.

### UUID (Universally Unique Identifier):
A UUID is a 128-bit identifier that is guaranteed to be unique across both space and time. Python's uuid module provides functions for generating UUIDs.
*args and **kwargs:
*args and **kwargs allow you to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively, in a function definition. *args collects extra positional arguments into a tuple, while **kwargs collects extra keyword arguments into a dictionary.

### Handling Named Arguments in a Function:
In Python, you can define functions that accept named arguments by using the syntax def my_function(arg1, arg2=value2, ...). These named arguments can have default values, which are used if the caller doesn't provide a value for them. Inside the function, you can access these named arguments like regular variables.

## How to start the project

## How to use it

## Command Interpreter

A command interpreter is a tool that allows you to interact with your project by entering commands. It's like a specialized interface where you can perform actions such as creating new users or places, retrieving objects, performing operations on objects, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

If you want to create a new user, you could use the following:

```python
create User
```

or if you want to retrieve objects you could use the following:

```python
retrieve User from database
```
